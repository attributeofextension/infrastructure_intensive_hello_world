# Infrastructure Intensive Hello World

The aim of this project is to avoid getting bogged down with creating an app worthy of publishing.
The app is simply a webserver that handles a single route and returns "Hello World".
The idea for this repo is to include infrastructure configuration that will deploy the Hello World web server to AWS, GCP and Azure.
